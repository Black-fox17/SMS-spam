# SMS Classification Model using NLP, CountVectorizer, and Naive Bayes
## Overview
This repository demonstrates the development of a robust SMS classification model using Natural Language Processing (NLP), the CountVectorizer technique, and the Naive Bayes algorithm. The goal is to create a model capable of classifying text messages as either spam or not spam with an accuracy exceeding 98%.

## Steps
**1. Dataset Loading**: The dataset is sourced from Kaggle, providing a diverse collection of SMS messages for training and evaluation.

**2. Notebook Usage**: A Jupyter notebook from Kaggle is utilized for the model development. The notebook provides an interactive and collaborative environment for experimenting with the code.

**3. NLP and CountVectorizer**: Natural Language Processing techniques, coupled with the CountVectorizer method, are employed to convert the text data into a format suitable for machine learning model training.

**4. Naive Bayes Algorithm**: The Naive Bayes algorithm is chosen for its effectiveness in text classification tasks. The model is trained on the dataset, taking advantage of the algorithm's probabilistic approach to achieve accurate spam and non-spam categorization.

**5. Achieving 98% Accuracy**: The model is fine-tuned and optimized to achieve a classification accuracy of over 98%, ensuring a high level of precision in distinguishing between spam and non-spam messages.
